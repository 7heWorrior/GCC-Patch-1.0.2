# Javascript skeleton 1.0.2

This skeleton incorporates changes for the Javascript skeleton for the Global Coding Challenge. For reference, files and folders added or modified include:

- .travis.yml
- package.json
- spec.js

These changes will need to be copied and pasted into your skeleton repositories in order for submissions to be valid.

To run tests locally, simply run all tests using your favoured IDE. Please note that this won't produce a green or red build.

## PLEASE NOTE: Once you have copied and pasted the files, DO NOT edit the spec.js file or the .travis.yml file.

Good luck!
